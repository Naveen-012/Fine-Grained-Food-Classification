"# Fine-Grained-Food-Classification" 
The development of an automatic food recognition system has several interesting applications ranging from waste food management, to advertisement, to calorie estimation, and daily diet monitoring. Despite the importance of this subject, the number of related studies is still limited.The primary objective of the project is to create an automated solution that can accurately identify various food items from images, facilitating the tracking and assessment of an individual's diet. This is achieved through the use of Region-based Convolutional Neural Networks (RCNN), a state-of-the-art algorithm known for its efficiency in object detection and classification, using VGG16 as the backbone for feature extraction. By leveraging a large dataset of food images, the RCNN model is trained to recognize different food types and portions with high precision. The system will also be integrated with a dietary assessment module, enabling users to obtain nutritional information, track caloric intake, and monitor food habits. This solution aims to offer a convenient, user-friendly tool for individuals and health professionals to improve dietary management and promote healthier eating practices. The project combines the power of deep learning with the practical needs of nutrition monitoring, presenting a novel approach to food analysis and health tracking. All the experiments are run on the UEC Food-100 database, because it is one of the most used databases, and it is challenging due to the presence of multi-food images, which need to be cropped before processing.The UEC Food-100 database stores 12,740 images of food for a total of 100 classes, most of the classes are Japanese food.
